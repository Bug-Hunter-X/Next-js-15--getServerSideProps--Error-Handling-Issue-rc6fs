In Next.js 15, a subtle bug can occur when using `getServerSideProps` with dynamic routes and data fetching.  If the data fetching within `getServerSideProps` throws an error, Next.js might not handle it gracefully, leading to a blank page or a generic error message, instead of a more informative error page. This is especially tricky to debug because the error might not be logged to the console in a way that's immediately obvious.  For instance, if you're making a fetch request and that request fails due to network issue or an API error, you might simply see a blank screen.
